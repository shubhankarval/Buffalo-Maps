# Buffalo Maps ðŸ“Œ
This project is built using Scala and uses [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map data for the City of Buffalo. The map data is loaded into XML format and processed to build a graph of streets that form an intersection. From this graph, a user is able to determine the shortest distance between two locations in Buffalo and produce driving directions to get from the starting point to the destination.
